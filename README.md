## Project Description

[According to the World Health Organization, heart disease is the leading cause of
death for both men and women worldwide, accounting for an estimated 32 percent of
deaths, making it even more important to focus on and prioritize heart health. In 2017, heart disease was listed as the underlying cause of over 860,000 deaths in the United
States. Each year, approximately 659,000 people in the United States die as a result of
heart disease. This means that heart disease kills one out of every four people in the
United States. The increasing number of heart disease deaths caught the attention and interest of our
team. Our team is committed to using data analysis and mechanistic learning to solve
real-world problems. We decided to use data analysis and machine learning to analyze
and solve potential problems inside the data of heart disease and work to contribute to
global health by studying and attempting to reduce the likelihood of heart disease]
